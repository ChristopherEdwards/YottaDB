# Todo list for Mac OS X Port

 * Make custom commands to massage GAS assembler files into something LLVM would use
 * Assembler macros for sigsetjmp and label jump g_msf.si.
 * Mach-O object files
 * Shared autolink routine libraries don't work b/c of mprotect issue on shared memory.
 * Import V6.3-000A sources
 * get clock time for Mac
 * Some defines overwrote MVS defines
 * Some files in sr_darwin are common; we don't need separate copies
 * sr_unix/extract_signal_info.c - FIXME, I just copied this
 * sr_unix/mu_cre_file.c - Mac OS X does not support posix_fallocate()
 * sr_unix/mutex.c - That #ifdef 0 should have probably just deleted the code since the variable
   wake_this_pid is not even defined
 * Current cmake file links against ncurses in ports, but we need to link
   against ncurses in the system libs so that we don't need macports on
   a Mac when just installing GT.M. Currently, that's the only reason
   we need MacPorts.
