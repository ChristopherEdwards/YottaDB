# Instructions to compile GT.M on Cygwin
These are quick instructions to first install Cygwin x86 and then compile GT.M on it. It will take a while as compiling on Cygwin/gcc is really slow.

Tested on Windows 10.

Open cmd as admin, and install chocolatey, and then install Cygwin x86. 

```
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
choco install cygwin -x86
```

You now need to open cygwin, in its default location under the START>All Programs>Cygwin>Cygwin Terminal. Once in, install apt-cyg and use that to install most software.

```
lynx -source rawgit.com/transcode-open/apt-cyg/master/apt-cyg > apt-cyg
install apt-cyg /bin
hash -r
```

Then you should google how to create a text file, fill contents from that location and make the file executable

Then install lots of stuff. But NOT!! cmake. The version in the repos is corrupt. We will compile cmake from source.
```
apt-cyg install wget git libelf0-devel zlib-devel libicu-devel libgpgme-devel libgpg-error-devel libgrcypt-devel openssl-devel tcsh libncurses-devel gcc4-g++ gdb automake make flex bison libnettle-devel libnettle
hash -r
```

Install both libconfig and cmake from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/hyperrealm/libconfig && cd libconfig
./configure
make
make install
cd
wget --no-check-certificate https://cmake.org/files/v3.4/cmake-3.4.0.tar.gz
tar xzvf cmake-3.4.0.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.4.0
./bootstrap && make && make install
```

Now, compile GT.M:
```
git clone https://github.com/shabiel/fis-gtm && cd fis-gtm
git checkout cygwin
cmake . (add debug options here or use ccmake)
make
make install
```
